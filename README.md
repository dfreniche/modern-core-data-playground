# Modern Core Data Playground: Core Data in Swift / Xcode... inside a Playground!

An introduction to Core Data you can test, use, change & code, all in just one Playground!

 ## The model used in this example
  
 Core Data wants to be the model of your App, [Markus Zarra](http://martiancraft.com/blog/2015/03/core-data-stack/) once dixit.
 
 So in this Playground we have a simple model:

- you can create __Projects__
- a Project has _name_, _priority_, _startDate_ and several _tasks_
- you can create and add _tasks_ to a _project_
- a __Task__ belongs to just one Project (it's a 1-n relationship, 1 Project can have n Tasks)
- a Task has _desc_ and _title_
 
 ```
|-----------------|               |----------------|
|    Project      |               |     Task       |
|-----------------| 1           n |----------------|
| name: String    |---------------|title: String   |
| priority: Int   |               |desc: String    |
| startDate: Date |               |                |
|-----------------|               |----------------|
 
 ```
 
 - You can browse the model opening the file [CoreDataModelHelper.xcdatamodeld](https://github.com/dfreniche/modern-core-data-playground/CoreDataModelHelper/CoreDataModelHelper/CoreDataModelHelper.xcdatamodeld)
 
 - Xcode 8 creates automagically in `Derived Folder` the Swift classes to represent your Core Data Entities. I've copied them inside the `Sources` folder > `Core Data Generated Files`
 
- for Project Entity, you have `Project+CoreDataProperties.swift`
 
## What you'll find here
 
- how to initialise the Core Data Stack using NSPersistentContainer
- how to create a fine - tuned NSPersistentContainer with a memory-only Core Data Stack
- how to do CRUD operations
- how to fetch, using generics
- how to use the Undo Manager
- ... and more to come


## Requirements
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) or greater
* Swift (included in Xcode)
* there are Xcode 8 (Swift 3) and 9 (Swift 4) versions. Look at the tags

## Installation

Clone the repo and open the playground directly in Xcode.

	$ git clone https://github.com/ && cd CoreDataPlayground
	$ open core-data-playground.playground


## Helper Project

I've used a helper project, just a simple Core Data template App to create the Core Data Model file and to let Xcode generate the Swift source code files for each Entity in that Model.

 ## Getting the mom file
 
 - We can add files to our `Resources` folder (open side Project Navigator with Cmd + 1)
 - In this playground we have a CoreDataModelHelper.xcdatamodel file (not the regular xcdatamodeld directory we use in Core Data projects). This file shows you the Core Data Model of this example.
 - I've run this code in the Simulator and extracted from the App Bundle the compiled version of the xcdatamodel, CoreDataModelHelper.mom, which is the one Core Data loads.

## Acknowledgements

I was wondering if I could run a complete Core Data example inside a Playground. Searching around to see if anyone has tried that before I found [Andrew Shepard's repo on Core Data]( https://github.com/andyshep/CoreDataPlayground.git). This inspired me to create my own, but with a twist: I didn't wanted to create the Managed Object Model in code.
